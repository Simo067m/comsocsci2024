[Before week 1](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2024/blob/main/lectures/Before_week_1.ipynb). Take a look at this page before you do anything. This class most likely works a little bit differently from other classes you've taken. The notebook explains pretty much everything - the rest will be explained during the lectures. In case the link doesn't work, you can also see the file [here](https://github.com/lalessan/comsocsci2024/blob/main/lectures/Before_week_1.ipynb) on Github, but the videos won't display properly


[Week 1: Intro to Computational Social Science](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2024/blob/main/lectures/Week1.ipynb). This week is all about getting started: learning about how the course works, make sure you master the tools you need to follow the class. I will give you an introduction to the field of Computational Social Science. And, we will start with something hands-on: you will learn about web-scraping and start gathering some data from the web.

 * __Reading__: [Bit by Bit, chapter 1](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/) Start by reading the Introduction of the book, where you will get you an understanding of the history of the field and the general framework.    

 * __Reading__:  [Bit by Bit, chapter 6](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/ethics/) Read the Ethics chapter of the book. Here, I don't expect you to read all the details. However, I want to make sure you get an overall understanding of the ethical challenges and some of the approaches that are used in the field to deal with these complex issues. You can focus on sections 6.4 and 6.6.
